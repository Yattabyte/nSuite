# Include the Doxygen configuration from another file.
# The file must be a relative path with respect to the root of the repository.
# If any of the options in this doxyfile include a path (ie, INPUT), these

# location of the DOXYFILE.

# Specify external repository to link documentation with.
# This is similar to Doxygen's TAGFILES option, but will automatically link to
# tags of other repositories already using CodeDocs. List each repository to
# link with by giving its location in the form of owner/repository.

#   TAGLINKS = doxygen/doxygen CodeDocs/osg
# Note: these repositories must already be built on CodeDocs.
